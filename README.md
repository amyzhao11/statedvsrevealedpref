stated vs revealed preferences and agent-based modelling

## Study1
This folder contains the speed-dating data that was used for analysis
Analyses.r contains the mlm analyses code for the trait-by-trait analyses in study 1 and the omnibus analyses in study 3.

## Study2
This folder contains the agent-based modelling code for Study 2. Inside each preference folder is the code to generate the data, as well as the code that performs the analyses

## Study3
This folder contains the agent-based modelling code for Study 3. A copy of the data generation code (preference importance for trait appeal, and preference level for (raw and corrected) pattern metric and Euclidean distance) are included, as well as the respective analyses code.


## abm_eastwick2011.r
Agent-based modelling simulations adjusted to the constraints reflected in Eastwick, Eagly, Finkel, and Johnson (2011). This relies on data generated by ABM importance data gen Eastwick.r

## abmextraparticipants.r
Exploring the effects of changing the number of participants per speed-dating session while retaining the same number of participants overall
